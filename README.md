# Kaggle-Bike-Sharing
Forecast use of a city bikeshare system

Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city.
The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded.In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program 
Multiple models were tested during this challenge (Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting,Decision Tree and Random Forest). Finally, the chosen model was Random Forest.
